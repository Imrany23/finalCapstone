Software Engineering Task 21 Part 2

### Project Description
This project was a task to incorporate all the Python programming techniques which were taught on the software engineering bootcamp course @HyperionDev including functions, input and output of files and create a Task Manager.

The task was to create functions and add functionality to a legacy solution of Task_manager.py. The task manager after logging in allows the users login and register with a username and password. The program allows users to 

* add tasks
* view all tasks
* view and edit the current user's tasks
* generate summary reports
* create a default admin account
* allow admin only access to display statistics

### Installation

To use this program you must have Python v3.11 installed on your computer and you should have access to code editor such MS Visual Code to run the code. 

To install this project please copy task_manager.py and create 2 empty input .txt files tasks.txt and users.txt in the same folder.

* task_manager.py  - contains all the python code required
* user.txt         - contains username and password details
* tasks.txt        - contains task details including
  * name
  * task_id
  * description,
  * assignment date
  * completed flag

### Usage

1. Run the file task_manager.py file in the Python editor or Python CMD shell
2. A default admin account is created with
   * username = admin
   * password = password
3. The program then gives the option to enter username or -1 to register or e to exit
   Initially login as admin and enter the credentials as per step 2
   ![lOGIN](login.JPEG)
5. Once logged in you will presented with the main menu with the options
