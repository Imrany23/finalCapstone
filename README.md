Software Engineering Task 21 Part 2

### Project Description
This project was a task to incorporate all the Python programming techniques which were taught on the software engineering bootcamp course @HyperionDev including functions, input and output of files and create a Task Manager.

The task was to create functions and add functionality to a legacy solution of Task_manager.py. The task manager after logging in allows the users login and register with a username and password. The program allows users to 

* add tasks
* view all tasks
* view and edit the current user's tasks
* generate summary reports
* create a default admin account
* allow admin only access to display statistics
